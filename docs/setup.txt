Installation Steps:

1. Select (or create) any mySQL database that will store all ALS data. Run the SQL command (this can be done in PHPMyAdmin or from a Linux Terminal window) on the database:

CREATE TABLE als_table (id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY (id), username VARCHAR(26), hash VARCHAR(60), altkey VARCHAR(20), email VARCHAR(50))

Recommended optional step: create a new mySQL user and give it only permissions to the database in step 1.

2. Open “als_settings.php” and set the following:

$als_database - The full database name in step 1.
$als_username - The username to an SQL account with permissions to the database.
$als_password - The password to that account.

Configure other options to how you see fit.

3. Upload all the contents of /src/ to the server and then open als_test.php in your web browser.
If you see “Setup complete!”, everything should be working.
